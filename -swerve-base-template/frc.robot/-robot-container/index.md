# RobotContainer



[jvm]\
open class [RobotContainer](index.html)

This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared. Since Command-based is a &quot;declarative&quot; paradigm, very little robot logic should actually be handled in the [Robot](../-robot/index.html) periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls). Instead, the structure of the robot (including subsystems, commands, and trigger mappings) should be declared here.
